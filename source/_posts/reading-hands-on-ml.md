Want to finish this [ml book](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646) for n-th time. 
I'm just gonna record it this time.  The code and progress can also be found [here](https://github.com/alfmunny/Hands-On-Machine-Learning).

Let's keep it up.

## Day 1 
Finished the first 4 Chapters two weeks before. Linear Regression, gradient decent, Logistic Regression, all basics. 
The End-to-End project is pretty helpful. GridSearch is very efficient for tweaking the parameters
