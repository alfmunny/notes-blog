Never use test data to do model selection. Generate validation set for it.
K-fold Cross-Validation is a cheap way to generate validation sets when the train data is scarce.
Get to know what is generalization error and training error. Overfitting, underfitting and model complexity. "Tunnable Parameters" -> "degree of freedom". Deep.
