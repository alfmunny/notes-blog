#DLPyTorch-3.4 [Softmax Regression for classification problems](https://d2l.ai/chapter_linear-networks/softmax-regression.html). 
Use the maximum likelihood estimation to get the loss function.  Same as to Linear Regression: Mean Squred Error.
As an intuition, softmax regression is like to add one more layer(softmax function) over the multiple linear regressions.
1. For n categories, we have n linear regressions. And then convert the n outputs to a distribution(**Softmax**).
2. To compare with the known distribution(calculated from labels), we use the **Cross Entropy** as the loss function.
