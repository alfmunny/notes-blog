#DLPyTorch3.5 - 3.7. Reread some softmax concepts. Maximum Likelihood Estimation is using product of all posibilities. Consider all events happen independently, what is the best the model that fits all the observations? Plug the observations into the model, calculate the whole prosibility of it, and maximize it. It's basic. Is linear model always a fully conntected layer? Seems to be.
